                  Starry Night is one of the most recognized pieces of art in the world.
                  It is absolutely everywhere, too. It can be seen on coffee, mugs, t-shirts,
                  towels, magnets, etc. Honestly, it sometimes feels as if the paintingâ€™s
                  fame has exceeded that of its creator. It is a magnificent piece of art.
                  That Starry Night resonates with so many people is a testament to how its beauty is timeless and universal.'
