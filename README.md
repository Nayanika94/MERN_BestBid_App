# BestBid

## Project Description

Online auctions offer buyers and sellers of a wide variety of goods an enormous platform for trade. They provide buyers with a virtual flea market, with an endless range of merchandise from around the world, and they give sellers a storefront from which to market everything from sports memorabilia to computer systems to millions of international buyers.

### How Online Auctions Work

Internet auctions are like giant online flea markets. Sellers may offer one item at a time or multiple lots of the same item. In theory, online auctions run much like local auctions, but behind the scenes, there is ongoing data collection. Just like local auctions, there are sellers and bidders -- and winners and losers. Winners are expected to pay for what they bid on at the conclusion of the auction. But that is where the similarities between online and local auctions end.

### Winning Bids

The bidding for each auction closes at the scheduled time. In the case of sales of multiple lots, the participants with the highest bids at the close of the auction are obligated to buy the items. If no one bids at or above the reserve price, the auction closes without a winner. At the close of a successful auction, the buyer and seller communicate, usually by email, to arrange for payment and delivery of the goods.
